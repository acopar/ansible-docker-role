Docker
======

Ansible role to install and configure Docker container engine on RHEL/CentOS 7.

**Main features:**

- Supports ``overlay2`` and ``devicemapper`` (with direct LVM) Docker storage
  drivers.
- Uses ``container-storage-setup`` (also known as ``docker-storage-setup``) to
  set up Docker's storage.
- Prevents users from running ``devicemapper`` driver `on a loopback device by
  default`_.
- Sets up convenient passwordless sudo access for running Docker for selected
  users `as recommended by Dan Walsh`_, lead of Red Hat's Docker team.
- Supports authenticating with private Docker registries.

**Limitations:**

- Automatically applying changes to the Docker storage configuration for an
  existing system is not supported. You will have to manually remove the
  contents of the ``/var/lib/docker`` directory and then run the role again.

Requirements
------------

This role requires Ansible 2.4 or higher.

It also requires RHEL/CentOS 7.4 or higher since OverlayFS support for SELinux
has been added in that version.
